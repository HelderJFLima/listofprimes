This program creates a list of prime numbers up to a certain value entered by the user. It is possible to enter the maximum value via the command line or just call the program and wait for it to request it.

The smallest prime number that is recorded in the list is FIRSTPRIME, which by default is 2. The largest value accepted by the program is ULON_MAX - 1, which may vary from machine to machine. If the user enters a value outside these limits, he will receive a message informing him of the problem and the program will not execute.

If everything goes well, the program will test whether the numbers between FIRSTPRIME and the desired value are primes and each one will be displayed on the screen during the process. The list of prime numbers will be saved in a file in the same folder as the program. The first line of the file informs the quantity of prime numbers recorded and the value of the last number in the list.

BE CAREFUL with the value entered to the program, as if it is too high it could take a considerable amount of time to complete the task.
